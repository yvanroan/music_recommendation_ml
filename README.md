# music_recommendation_ml

This is a machine learning recommendation app made in python that uses text analysis and content filtering to recommend a new playlist to users.

This app takes in the link of the playlist we need recommendations for on Spotify and compares the given playlist to a JSON file(we can't directly compare to the Spotify database) containing various playlists to provide them with about 30 tracks that might be suitable for them.
